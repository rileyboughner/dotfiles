### My OS!

 - These dotfiles use stow and nix to configure all of my computers (including my server)

### TODO

- [ ] find a good way of creating just a dotfiles repo without the nix stuff
- [ ] find better way of saving firefox config
- [ ] update the install script to move the hardware file into hardare and then assist the user in renameing and rebuilding from scratch
- [ ] prompt the user to install wallpapers from a git repo
- [ ] learn more about nix

### Stuff to know
wallpapers are stored in ~/.wallpapers and the last chosen wallpaper is stored in ~/.wallpaper
choose monitor my copying monitor-setting.sample as monitor-setting and source a monitor file 
all of this is stored in ~/.dotfiles/config/hypr/monitors

### Cool Commands
git config --global credential.helper store
