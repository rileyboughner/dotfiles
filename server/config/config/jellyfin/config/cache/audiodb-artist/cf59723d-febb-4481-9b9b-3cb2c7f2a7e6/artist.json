It\u2019s 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s punk rock meets raw, hillbilly east Texas country music. This album marries the authenticity of Koe\u2019s live performance with an even better look into the mind and soul of the writer behind the pen, all at the same time appreciating the wit and heart of Koe in his nature as a fun-loving dude who loves to have a good time. Everyone who complained about having to wait for a new album from Koe gets more than they deserved and likely expected. \u201cHarold Saul High\u201d is sure to be one of the few albums that defines this generation of Texas music.\u201d - Buddy Logan","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"Male","intMembers":"1","strCountry":"Stephenville, Texas, USA","strCountryCode":"US","strArtistThumb":"https://r2.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/rrqrxy1561319752.jpg","strArtistLogo":null,"strArtistCutout":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/cutout/4cftvh1663621522.png","strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":null,"strArtistFanart2":null,"strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"cf59723d-febb-4481-9b9b-3cb2c7f2a7e6","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
