He signed with Big Loud Records and released an extended play and a single, \"The Way I Talk.\" His father was a preacher, and as a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He played baseball in college, but chose to look for music instead after an injury. In 2014, he competed in season 6 of The Voice, but was eliminated.\nAt the end of 2016, Wallen signed with Big Loud Records, a label owned by record producer Joey Moi. He released his debut single \"The Way I Talk\" shortly after. In addition, he co-wrote the single \"Preachin 'to the Choir of A Thousand Horses.\" In April 2017, Wallen released a music video for \"The Way I Talk\". She also joined the Florida Georgia Line to set dates on her Dig Your Roots Tour. He\u2019s a passionate singer with a unique sound who grew up in Appalachia, and you\u2019ll be hearing Morgan Wallen before 2016 is over. Wallen moved to Nashville in July 2015, not sure what he would find, but convinced that he should at least give his dreams a legitimate shot. Less than a year later, he\u2019d already been signed to Big Loud Records, recorded some initial tracks with producer Joey Moi (Florida Georgia Line, Jake Owen) and hit the road on his first radio promotion tour.\nIt might appear that Wallen\u2019s on the fast track, but it took him a while to get there. Born in Sneedville, Tennessee (a town that also lays claim as the birthplace of bluegrass pioneer Jimmy Martin), to a hard-rock-lovin\u2019 preacher and contemporary-Christian-devoted teacher, Wallen showed his musical interests early, singing in front of the local congregation at age three and asking for a violin for his fifth birthday. He would soon switch to piano and later add guitar to his arsenal, though he never really imagined it was possible to make a career of it.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that was realistic because I had no clue about how the music business worked,\u201d Wallen says. \u201cEven living three hours away, I had no idea about Nashville.\u201d\nInstead, he focused his efforts on baseball, and he was pretty good at it. Playing shortstop and pitcher for Gibbs High School in Corryton, the same school where Kenny Chesney graduated. Wallen earned an offer to continue playing at a major college.\nBut fate intervened. While pitching during his senior year, he felt a pop in his right elbow and would undergo a tendon replacement procedure. While he was able to continue playing guitar and piano, it proved to be the end of his baseball career.\n\u201cLooking back, I\u2019m glad it happened the way it did, because I really actually loved music more than I ever did baseball,\u201d he says.\nThe kind of music almost didn\u2019t matter. Rock, hip-hop, country \u2013 he loved it all, particularly the emotional connection that it created between the musician and the listener. But when he wrote, the music was invariably country.\n\u201cWriting music was a way for me to get my feelings out,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t really express my feelings very much, and I guess it was just a way for me to let some of that go. It\u2019s my safe place.\u201d\nHis mother signed him up to audition for NBC\u2019s The Voice, convinced that he\u2019d do well. Wallen had no idea what to expect \u2013 he\u2019d never seen the show \u2013 but he was chosen by Usher and was later stolen by Adam Levine. The last song he performed during his run, a cover of Florida Georgia Line\u2019s \u201cStay,\u201d helped him steer him toward his creative destiny.\n\u201cHonestly, I was just trying to figure out who I was,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI was trying to figure out me as a person, me as an artist. It was one way to do it.\u201d\nDuring his time in California, Wallen met Sergio Sanchez, the lead singer and writer for Jive Records\u2019 hard-rock band Atom Smash. While Sanchez initially served as Wallen\u2019s vocal coach, they hit it off and started co-writing regularly in Knoxville. Armed with new music, Wallen and Sanchez moved to Nashville and became ingrained in the city\u2019s music community. From there, things moved quickly. Wallen\u2019s managers, Dirk Hemsath and Mike Bachta of Working Group Artist Management, set him up to play for William Morris Endeavor\u2019s Kevin Neal, agent for Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line. Neal signed him on the spot. Hemsath and Bachta next sent demos to Big Loud Shirt\u2019s Seth England, hoping to land some co-writing opportunities with songwriters at the publishing company. England was so impressed that he brought Morgan in to audition for his partners in Big Loud Records: Craig Wiseman, Clay Hunnicutt, Kevin \u201cChief\u201d Zaruk and Joey Moi. They signed Wallen to both the label and the publishing company.\nWallen started woodshedding as a songwriter, working with the likes of Wiseman (\u201cLive Like You Were Dying\u201d), Rodney Clawson (\u201cDirt\u201d), Chris Tompkins (\u201cDrunk On A Plane\u201d), the Warren Brothers (\u201cHighway Don\u2019t Care\u201d), Tommy Cecil (\u201cHome Alone Tonight\u201d) and Matt Dragstrem (\u201cSippin\u2019 On Fire\u201d). Meanwhile, Big Loud proved that it was big-league \u2013 while Wallen worked on his own music, the label\u2019s first-ever single, Chris Lane\u2019s \u201cFix,\u201d went into the Top 15 and continued climbing, an unheard-of start for a brand-new label.\nWallen hopes to build a similar story. He headed out on a promotion tour of radio stations in the summer of 2016, giving him a chance to start playing for people again after spending so much of the previous year in writing rooms and the recording studio. The end goal is to be on a stage, making that emotional connection with his distinctive sound. But it takes time to get there.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just really been trying to get the focus on the music,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have that, then there\u2019s no point in playing.\u201d","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":"Morgan Cole Wallen (Sneedville, 13 de mayo de 1993) es un cantante y compositor de m\u00fasica country estadounidense.\nFirm\u00f3 con Big Loud Records y lanz\u00f3 cuatro sencillos: \u00abThe Way I Talk\u00bb, \u00abUp Down\u00bb, que colabora Florida Georgia Line, \u00abWhiskey Glasses\u00bb y su sencillo actual \u00abChasin 'You\u00bb.\nMorgan naci\u00f3 en Sneedville, Tennessee.\u200b Su padre era pastor bautista y cuando era ni\u00f1o, Morgan tom\u00f3 clases de piano y viol\u00edn.
